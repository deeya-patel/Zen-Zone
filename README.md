Access: This website is accessible by downloading the folder of files, opening Android Studio, opening the folder to access the project, connecting an emulator within the Android Studio app to display the user experience or connecting an Android device with Wi-Fi, and finally, clicking the play button to run the app.

Current Design: Android App built using Android Studio, Java, and XML during HackHERS 2024 to provide users with activities to alleviate common mental health symptoms. One activity displays a spinner that can be clicked to play an ASMR sound. Limitations of this activity include low volume for each sound. Another activity promotes deep breaths and consists of a countdown for inhaling and exhaling.

Targeted Design: The goal is to include many more quick, calming activities for users to interact with when needed as well as eventually deploying the mobile app.
