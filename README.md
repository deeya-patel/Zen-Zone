Android App built using Android Studio, Java, and XML during HackHERS 2024.
The project is incomplete, but the vision includes providing several calming activities to users struggling with mental health issues. 
One activity displays a spinner that can be clicked to play an ASMR sound. Limitations of this activity include low volume for each sound and continuous playing even when home button is clicked.
Another activity promotes deep breaths, but is currently not functional.
The goal of this project is to include many more options of short, but alleviating activities.
